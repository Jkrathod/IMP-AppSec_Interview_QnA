**`What is OAuth?`**

Answer:OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for authorization that enables users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their passwords. OAuth is a widely-used protocol that is supported by many popular websites and applications, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

Here is how OAuth works:

    The user visits a website or application that wants to access their resources.
    The website or application redirects the user to the OAuth authorization server.
    The authorization server prompts the user to grant access to the resources.
    The user grants or denies access.
    The authorization server returns a token to the website or application.
    The website or application uses the token to access the user's resources.
