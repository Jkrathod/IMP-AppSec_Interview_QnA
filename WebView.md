##### What is a WebView?  

The WebView class, which is an extension of the View class in Android, can be used to show a web page as part of your activity layout. It doesn’t have navigation buttons or an address bar, which are two important parts of a web browser. By default, WebView’s only job is to show a web page. 

Android applications use WebViews to load content and HTML pages inside the application. Due to this functionality, the WebView implementation must be secure to prevent potential risk to the application. 

Besides, WebView poses a serious security risk to both the device and the application. While conducting an Android assessment, mobile penetration testers should look at the following techniques and their current conditions to find any potential dangers. 

    setAllowContent Access 
    setAllowFileAccess 
    setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs 
    setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs 
    SetJavaScriptEnabled 

The following are the WebView settings that are most commonly exploited by attackers:

    setAllowContentAccess: This setting controls whether the WebView can access content from the internet. If this setting is enabled, an attacker can trick the WebView into loading a malicious file from a remote server.
    
    setAllowFileAccess: This setting controls whether the WebView can access files on the device. If this setting is enabled, an attacker can trick the WebView into downloading a malicious file to the device.
    
    setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs: This setting controls whether the WebView can access files that are hosted on the same domain as the WebView itself. If this setting is enabled, an attacker can trick the WebView into loading a malicious file from a local file.
    
    setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs: This setting controls whether the WebView can access files from any domain. If this setting is enabled, an attacker can trick the WebView into loading a malicious file from any website.
    
    SetJavaScriptEnabled: This setting controls whether the WebView can execute JavaScript code. If this setting is enabled, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the WebView, which can then be executed by the victim's browser.
