**`What are the Diffrent types of XXE ? and Recommendations ?`**

There are basically two types of XXE attacks
-In Band XXE: In-band XXE attacks are more common and let the attacker receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.

-Out Of Band XXE (Blind XXE): in the case of out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the    web application.
