**`What are the Diffrent types of XXE?and Recommendations ?`**

There are basically two types of XXE attacks

- In Band XXE: In-band XXE attacks are more common and let the attacker receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.

- Out Of Band XXE (Blind XXE): in the case of out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application.
